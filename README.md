# Overview
I wanted to refresh my Alogrithms and Data Structures skills in order to break any bad habits I created and to reteach myself the fundamentals I have forgetten. I followed an online course that went over everything from stacks to binary search trees
I was surprised at how much of the simple things I had forgot and by how much I rely on one datastructure when there are more efficienct ways. The biggest take away for me was the capability to wait and think about the different ways to solve a problem would be. Instead of relying on hash tables I can look at other datastructures liked LinkedLists or a recusive method that would be a little more code but more efficient. Going over big O notation was also very helpful, it is something I always kind of brushed off and assumed I would understand eventually when I got around to it, but now I have gotten around to it! It really was not as complicated as it seems.

I am very happy I took the time to do this, even though it was tedious, because now I am extremely confident in my foundation of DSA and I can already see this paying off as I continue to work on larger projects and solve leetcode problems.

## File Breakdown
I have attached all the files in one main section because I didn't want to deal with the making separate files for every topic in java. The big thing to note, are my notes. I took detailed notes on every concept in the notes.md file and did a small project for concept to gain understanding.
